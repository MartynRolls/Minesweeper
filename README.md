## Minesweeper with pythons Pygame library

I love minesweeper, I love coding, doesn't that just work out brilliantly?

Over the past few weeks I've been working on this adding features to my copy that others have. 
One of the features I don't have is an actual flag sprite, because everything else is drawn in squares, so why can't the flag be that? A big square.

I'm terrible at commenting my code, because only God and I need to know what's going on here, but I (kinda) tried.
Also, when looking up a tile, you have to search using (y, x) instead of (x, y) because I was to far in when I thought to change it.

Any places for improvement? Let me know!
