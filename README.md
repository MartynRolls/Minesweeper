## Minesweeper with pythons Pygame library

I love minesweeper, I love coding, doesn't that just work out brilliantly?

Over the past few weeks I've been working in my free time on this, adding features to my copy that others have. 
One of the features I don't have is an actual flag sprite, because everything else is drawn in squares, so why can't the flag be that? A big square.

I'm terrible at commenting my code, because only God and I need to know what's going on here, but I (kinda) tried.
Also, when looking up a tile, you have to search using (y, x) instead of (x, y) because I was to far in when I thought to change it.

I just popped it on here once it was done. There are most of the standard minesweeper features. 
To change the size, you have to go into the source code and change the variables from Game = Minesweeper(variables).

There was also time for me to make it pretty by using some colours not stolen from the google minesweeper, and adding particles when you uncover a tile.

All in all, I present to you a functional minesweeper, using as little space as I could muster. Made with the pygame library.
